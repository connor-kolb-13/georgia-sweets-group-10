Trent:
1). Yesterday I began writing the JS for adding images to the gallary page. The image links are to be pulled from Firebase after they are uploaded from the admin dashboard.
2). Today I plan to contimue working on the code to display images on the gallary page. 
3). The biggest problem I am facing is that I can't complete the gallary page image display code until the ability to upload the images on the admin dashboard is finislized. 


Mason:
1). Yesterday I talked with the client to make sure her goals were still consistent with our's. I ensures that the progess we were making was what she liked.
2). Today, I am planning to start writting the JavaScript for uploading images as an admin to reflect the public website available to all to view.
3). I was looking a bit into uploading images and I am confused on how to create a database and update that through JS. I may need to look back at previous class projects to refresh my memory.

Trent:
1). Yesterday I was able to finalize the code to display the already uploaded images on the gallary page. 
2). Today, I plan to reference our origional protoype to ensure we are staying on the track with the design approved by our customer.

Mason:
1). Yesterday I finished up allowing the admin to add images to the gallery page, and ensuring that it is added to the gallery_images database.
