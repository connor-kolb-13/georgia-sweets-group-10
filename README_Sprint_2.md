## April 6th Stand Up

Connor:


Alex:
1. Yesterday I worked on creating the user table for the manage users page for admins
2. Today I continued to work on the user table
3. No problems at this time

Isaac:



Trent:
1). Yesterday I began writing the JS for adding images to the gallary page. The image links are to be pulled from Firebase after they are uploaded from the admin dashboard.
2). Today I plan to contimue working on the code to display images on the gallary page. 
3). The biggest problem I am facing is that I can't complete the gallary page image display code until the ability to upload the images on the admin dashboard is finislized. 


Mason:
1). Yesterday I talked with the client to make sure her goals were still consistent with our's. I ensures that the progess we were making was what she liked.
2). Today, I am planning to start writting the JavaScript for uploading images as an admin to reflect the public website available to all to view.
3). I was looking a bit into uploading images and I am confused on how to create a database and update that through JS. I may need to look back at previous class projects to refresh my memory.

## April 11th Stand Up

Connor:


Alex:
1. Yesterday I helped to finish up the user table with Connor
2. Today I worked on the button to remove users from the user table
3. We had dicussions on how to best remove users, allow users themselves to do so or deleting them from the JS in firebase and from the page. 

Isaac:



Trent:
1). Yesterday I was able to finalize the code to display the already uploaded images on the gallary page. 
2). Today, I plan to reference our origional protoype to ensure we are staying on the track with the design approved by our customer.
3). The only minor challenge I am facing is looking into if we are able to allow administrators to delete user accounts. 

Mason:
1). Yesterday I finished up allowing the admin to add images to the gallery page, and ensuring that it is added to the gallery_images database.
2). Today, I am planning to allow the admin to delete images from the database driectly off of the webpage.
3). I am not facing any challenges at the moment.

# Sprint Review

a. What did you learn from doing our second sprint?
We learned from the second sprint that encouraging advice from our teammates can be very helpful. An example of this is for the deleting users function for the manage users aspect of the website. This was helpful because after further discussion we recognized that the website would work better and be more secure if we allowed users to only delete their own accounts, compared to the admin being able to deleting all. 

b. What did go well? Why?
Communication went better this sprint as we were more consistently updating each other in our group chat on where we were at with our tasks along with our stand up meetings. This was very helpful as we knew not to do repetitive work and also when to push and pull so there were no issues on that end. 


c. What didnâ€™t go well? Why not?
One thing that didn't go well on this sprint was the timing of our tasks. As the semester is winding down, we all have a lot of school work for our classes and work tended to be done in spurts rahter than a very consistent flow of work. This made it difficult sometimes as certain tasks needed to be done after others and we would have to wait to get those tasks done. 


d. How can you make things better next time?
This is never completely avoidable because we will all be busy over the next month, however in the future letting others know of our schedule beforehand and help us to lay out the sprint and know when the items will be completed better. 


e. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
We are very satisfied with what we have alrady completed as the page is working as it is supposed to and has a nice design and look to it. 

f. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
We were all present for these standup meetings. Beyond this Mason we also worked with the client to get consistent feedback throughout the process of the sprint. We observed that this was helpful to figure out if we were on the right track with the client's hopes for this project.
