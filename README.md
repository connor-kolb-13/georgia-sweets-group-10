# User Stories
1. As a customer, I want to have a clean, professional looking, gallery page where I can view past products to inspire a custom box, or help me decide on a holiday box to order.

2. As a customer, I want to be able to track my current orders, to see where in the process the order is, and its expected completition (either pick up or delivery) date.

3. As an admin, I want to be able to add holiday packs to the shop, with the ability to insert images and a description of the box (as well as the price).
